Match-3 style game in C# by Daniel Downes

This project is mainly an exercise to demonstrate my personal coding style and ability.

The project also acts as a playground to practise different aritectual and coding practises that can be easily shared (i.e. not under NDA) to those parties who are interested.

The following C# features are implemented, and explainations are provided here as well as within the code:

Explicit public and private method declarations
  Keeps things organised and looks neater.

Events and Delegates

Properties

(Lambda Expressions)
