The provided GPL applies to all included files in this repository.
The only exception to this are all visual design data and sound data.

The FLA structure and naming is covered under the GPL as part of 
the "game/project" work, but the design (bitmap/vector) art and sound 
binary data may be considered additional/alternative works not 
compatible with the GPL. Such sound and graphic assets only "enhance" 
the overall product and should be seen as separate creative works. 
The said assets are not directly dependent or required to allow the 
freedoms of the source-code and other data as described under the GPL.

The GPL is not necessarily applied at the individual file level. The 
FLA files can be modified as the naming and structure contained 
within the FLA files may be dependent by the source-code.

If the user wishes to make a derivative work from these works 
contained in this repository, they may do so but only for such 
work covered by the GPL, specifically the source-code and its 
dependencies. In such cases above mentioned graphic and sound 
data files must be replaced with original works as these are 
considered copyright and proprietary assets.

This license should remain unmodified with the complete repository
and all derived branches.
