Match-3 style game in C# by Daniel Downes

This project is mainly an exercise to demonstrate my personal coding style and ability.

The project also acts as a playground to practise different aritectual and coding practises that can be easily shared (i.e. not under NDA) to those parties who are interested.


Todo:
Touch support
Scoring UI
Swappable Gem Hint Visual (logic implemented)
Game Over UI


Notes:

'internal' instead of 'public'
